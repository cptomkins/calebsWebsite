My fascination with spatial design began in secondary school, where I explored architectural drafting and fell in love with creating floor plans.  However, the introduction to 3D design ignited a new passion. I found myself drawn to the dynamic world of 3D animation, where I could apply my spatial skills in a more engaging and interactive way.
