At Drexel University, I immersed myself in 3D modeling, animation, rendering, compositing, and even coding. Juggling coursework with multiple part-time jobs and freelance animation projects, I honed my skills and built a diverse portfolio.  A cloud computing research internship further expanded my knowledge, and leading my thesis animation team solidified my leadership abilities.
