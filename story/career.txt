Post-graduation, I dedicated myself to mastering 3D scenes and Python scripting within Maya. This led to a pivotal moment at the Siggraph Conference, where I connected with recruiters from Mikros Animation. Now, as a Technical Director, I've had the privilege of contributing to beloved projects like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Paw Patrol, and Thelma the Unicorn, collaborating with both animation and pipeline teams.
